# Context
This project was made for the lecture in astronomy "Academic Research, Writing and Presenting (2024W)" at the University of Vienna. A test paper was written, based on a real paper. The orignial paper can be found under those links: https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/09/aa46597-23/aa46597-23.html and https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...677A..86L%2F/abstract . 
My final paper contains 5 pages, but the specification just mentioned a minimum length of 3-4 pages. 

The original paper is: aa46597-23.pdf

Furthermore, a presentation were made, it can also be found in the project.

# Specification

In the paper assignment you are writing up what you presented with just a bit more space using all the possibilities the A&A style has to offer. Please upload your A&A paper here.

There are several MUST criteria. Your score is significantly reduced if you are not meeting them:

- must use the A&A style
- must upload until end of 7th of Feb (the ultimate deadline is 14 Feb after which the upload feature closes)
- must make use of references, figures, tables, equations, captions
- must contain your name(!) and must cite your input paper correctly
- must contain a mimicked plot - see (1) below
- minimum length is 3-4 pages (depending on the amount of figures)
- must contain a summary/outlook/conclusion
- must be uploaded as a .zip file containing the .pdf file and the .tex sources
- must be your own creation - see (2) below

 There are further penalties if:

- your text has obviously not been proof-read
- minimalism or copy/pasteism is the dominating impression
- careless use of LaTeX

You can also achieve extra points for bringing in significant extras, like diving deeper into the topic with extra references. But please concentrate on the MUST criteria first!

(1) We want you to exercise plotting in Python. Take one of the plots from your paper and try to recreate it in Python. This will involve you to create dummy data first. The plots don't need to be identical, just show that you could also do it!

(2) It is okay to make use of bots as a tool, e.g. for speeding up writing the introduction into the general topic, for improving the text, etc. It is not okay to use bots as a ghostwriter. Your contribution should outweigh anything that comes from any tool. Please bear in mind Â©Ottensamer: "science starts, where copy/paste ends".
